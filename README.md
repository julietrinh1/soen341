## Objective

Develop an e-commerce website.

## Project
This web application allows users to purchase items online. Users must create an account and login to be able to browse for products and add articles to their cart. When the user is ready to check out, he/she can add a payment method and proceed with the purchase. The order will be processed and can be viewed or cancelled by the user. 

## Core Features
The core features of this project are browsing through the products offered by the store, adding these products to a virtual shopping cart, and checking out.
